# coureraArrays-Lists-and-Structured-Data
Online Java Specialization course by  Duke University, 


  1. Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS

  2. Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software

  3. Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data

  4. Java Programming: Principles of Software Design

  5. Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System


#####Projects Overview
Centered around projects, this Specialization will help you create a portfolio of work to demonstrate your new programming skills. In the capstone you will create a recommender engine similar to those used by Netflix or Amazon. Additional projects in your portfolio will include:an interactive webpage that applies filters to images, an analysis of CSV data files, an encryption program, and a predictive text generator.


#####COURSE 3
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
Upcoming session: Oct 17 — Nov 21.
Commitment
4 weeks of study, 4-8 hours/week

#####About the Course
Build on the software engineering skills you learned in “Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software” by learning new data structures. Use these data structures to build more complex programs that use Java’s object-oriented features. At the end of the course you will write an encryption program and a program to break your encryption algorithm.

After completing this course, you will be able to:

    1. Read and write data from/to files;
    2. Solve problems involving data files;
    3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages); 
    4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList;
    5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems;
    6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.
